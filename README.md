ðŸŽ‰ Câ€‘Fâ€‘U Bridge: Open Source Dev Board for Optical Fiber & Copper â†’ USBâ€¯3.1 ðŸŽ‰

In the world of IoT and highâ€‘performance networksâ€”where optical fiber is rapidly becoming the standardâ€”you need a nimble, versatile tool to handle both optical and copper signals. Introducing Câ€‘Fâ€‘U Bridge, my openâ€‘source dev board designed for development and debugging:

ðŸ”Œ Optical Fiber Input

SFP slot (INFâ€‘8074i standard)

Supports pluggable transceivers from 1â€¯Gbit/s up to 4.25â€¯Gbit/s (and SFP+ for higher speeds)

âš¡ USBâ€¯3.1 Gen1 Output

Direct connection of optical or copper signals, no intermediate switch

Up to 5â€¯Gbit/s in Gen1 mode

ðŸ”„ Conversion Modes (selectable via DIP switch)

Opticalâ€¯â†’â€¯USB

Copperâ€¯â†’â€¯USB

Opticalâ€¯â†’â€¯Copper

ðŸ¤– STM32 MCU with Integrated IÂ²C

Dynamic register configuration of onboard chips via IÂ²C

Eliminates the need for external EEPROM

ðŸ’¡ LAN7801 Controller (Microchip Technology)

Highâ€‘performance USBâ€¯3.1â€¯â†’â€¯Gigabit Ethernet conversion

Fullâ€‘duplex, autoâ€‘negotiation, Wakeâ€‘onâ€‘LAN, advanced power saving

Compact QFNâ€‘64 package, ideal for embedded applications
